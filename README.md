Indoor position system for Web
#What is it
It's a Indoor position system for Web<br>
I write it for my company several mouth ago.but manager said <br>"I Choose the WPF version,Because HTML5 WAS NOT VERIFIED BY CONSUMER" <br>screw you manger!!!
So I decided make it open source since it will never Offical used
#How it works
The Backend is based on pomelo which is created by NetEase and based on node.js.Every map has it's own server<br>
The Web is based on Cocos2d-HTML5; It's a incredible WebGL engine;<br>

#PS.
